# Visum Lists to Pandas Dataframes

## Summary

This repo contains the base code to get data from a Visum list and convert it into a pandas dataframe for further processing. The data can also optionally be exported as .att files for QA purposes or analysis at a later date if required.

## Example Files

The `Example` folder contains a Visum .ver file and some example code for obtaining data from a variety of lists in a dataframe format. The functions in the example code are the same as the main script and aren't required to be changed, but the main section of code gives examples of how the functions can be used.

## Assumptions

- These scripts have been tested using Visum 2021 but should be largely compatible with other versions of Visum
